# Assumptions
1. The input will be given as a string.
1. The upper-right coordinates of the rectangular world will always be positive integers.
1. The initial position of each robot will be within the boundaries of the rectangular world.
1. The orientation of the robot will always be one of the following: N, S, E, W.
1. The instructions for each robot will only contain the characters L, R, and F.

# Estimate
Developing a complete solution for this problem, including parsing the input, implementing the logic, handling edge cases, and writing unit tests would take approximately 16-20 hours.
